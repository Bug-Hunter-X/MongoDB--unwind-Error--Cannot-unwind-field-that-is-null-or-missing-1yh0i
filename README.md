# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline: Handling potential errors in `$unwind`

This example demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$unwind` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The issue arises when the preceding `$lookup` stage does not find any matching documents, leading to an empty array which `$unwind` cannot process correctly. 

The `bug.js` file illustrates the problem, showing how the `$unwind` stage throws an error if no match is found.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using `$ifNull` and `$addFields` to handle the cases where no match is found.
